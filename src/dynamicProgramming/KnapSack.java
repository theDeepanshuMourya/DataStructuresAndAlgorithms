/*
 * You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to 
 * get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and 
 * weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack 
 * capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset 
 * is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t 
 * pick it (0-1 property).
